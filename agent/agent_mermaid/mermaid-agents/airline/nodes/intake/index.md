# Intake

1. Greet the customer and ask how you can help.
2. Capture: **user id** (required for book/modify/cancel), trip type (book / modify / cancel / complaint / general question), and when relevant: origin, destination, dates, reservation id or reference numbers.
3. If the user does not know their reservation id, note that you can help locate it later using tools (during modify or cancel).
4. If the request is ambiguous, ask one or two short clarifying questions; then proceed to classify.
